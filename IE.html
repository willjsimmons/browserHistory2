    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The first web browser was invented in 1990 by Tim Berners-Lee. It was called WorldWideWeb (no spaces) and was
      later renamed Nexus. In 1993, Marc Andreesen created a browser that was easy to use and install with the release
      of Mosaic (later Netscape), "the world's first popular browser", which made the World Wide Web system easy to use
      and more accessible to the average person. Andreesen's browser sparked the internet boom of the 1990s. These are
      the two major milestones in the history of the Web.

      The wars put the Web in the hands of millions of ordinary PC users, but showed how commercialization of the Web
      could stymie standards efforts. Both Microsoft and Netscape liberally incorporated proprietary extensions to HTML
      in their products, and tried to gain an edge by product differentiation, leading to the acceptance of the
      Cascading Style Sheets proposed by Hakon Wium Lie over Netscape's JavaScript Style Sheets (JSSS) by W3C.

      The first Internet Explorer was derived from Spyglass Mosaic. The original Mosaic came from NCSA, but since NCSA
      was a public entity it relied on Spyglass as its commercial licensing partner. Spyglass in turn delivered two
      versions of the Mosaic browser to Microsoft, one wholly based on the NCSA source code, and another engineered from
      scratch but conceptually modeled on the NCSA browser. Internet Explorer was initially built using the Spyglass,
      not the NCSA source code. The license to Microsoft provided Spyglass (and thus NCSA) with a quarterly fee plus a
      percentage of Microsoft's revenues for the software.

      In March 2009 Version 8.0 was released, with the first public beta having been released on March 5, 2008. IE8
      offered better support for web standards than previous versions, with plans for improved support for RSS, CSS, and
      Ajax, as well as full compliance for Cascading Style Sheets 2.1. It was also the first version to successfully
      pass the Acid2 test. In addition, Internet Explorer 8 included new features such as WebSlices and an improved
      phishing filter.
