    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The first web browser was invented in 1990 by Tim Berners-Lee. It was called WorldWideWeb (no spaces) and was
      later renamed Nexus. In 1993, Marc Andreesen created a browser that was easy to use and install with the release
      of Mosaic (later Netscape), "the world's first popular browser", which made the World Wide Web system easy to use
      and more accessible to the average person. Andreesen's browser sparked the internet boom of the 1990s. These are
      the two major milestones in the history of the Web.

      The wars put the Web in the hands of millions of ordinary PC users, but showed how commercialization of the Web
      could stymie standards efforts. Both Microsoft and Netscape liberally incorporated proprietary extensions to HTML
      in their products, and tried to gain an edge by product differentiation, leading to the acceptance of the
      Cascading Style Sheets proposed by Hakon Wium Lie over Netscape's JavaScript Style Sheets (JSSS) by W3C.
