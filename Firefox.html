    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The first web browser was invented in 1990 by Tim Berners-Lee. It was called WorldWideWeb (no spaces) and was
      later renamed Nexus. In 1993, Marc Andreesen created a browser that was easy to use and install with the release
      of Mosaic (later Netscape), "the world's first popular browser", which made the World Wide Web system easy to use
      and more accessible to the average person. Andreesen's browser sparked the internet boom of the 1990s. These are
      the two major milestones in the history of the Web.

      The wars put the Web in the hands of millions of ordinary PC users, but showed how commercialization of the Web
      could stymie standards efforts. Both Microsoft and Netscape liberally incorporated proprietary extensions to HTML
      in their products, and tried to gain an edge by product differentiation, leading to the acceptance of the
      Cascading Style Sheets proposed by Hakon Wium Lie over Netscape's JavaScript Style Sheets (JSSS) by W3C.

    <p>The project which became Firefox started as an experimental branch of the Mozilla Suite called m/b (or
      mozilla/browser). After it had been sufficiently developed, binaries for public testing appeared in September 2002
      under the name Phoenix.

      Firefox 23 was released on August 6, 2013. It includes an updated Firefox logo, mixed content blocking enabled by
      default to defend against man-in-the-middle attacks, implementation of the range form control attribute in HTML5,
      dropping support for the blink HTML element as well as text-decoration:blink CSS element, the restriction to have
      to "switch to a different search provider across the entire browser," and a global browser console, a new network
      monitor among other things.
